1. CMGTuple -> (Semi-final) Analysis Tree

move to the following directories depending on the channel
CMGTools/H2TauTau/th_analysis/EMuTau
CMGTools/H2TauTau/th_analysis/MuMuTau

where you can find the python configuration file
CMGTools/H2TauTau/th_analysis/EMuTau/emutau_2014_cfg.py
CMGTools/H2TauTau/th_analysis/MuMuTau/mumutau_2014_cfg.py


2. Produce final trees

move to the following directories
CMGTools/H2TauTau/th_analysis/EMuTau/analysis
CMGTools/H2TauTau/th_analysis/MuMuTau/analysis

and do,

python sync.py --mode signal --region f12 --phys WZ (see config.py to see the physics name)

There is the script, do.sh, by which you can do this altogether


3. python BDTmaker.py (For Jan to produce the BDT tree etc)
